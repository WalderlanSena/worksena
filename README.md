## About Worksena

WorkSena is a micro framework PHP, developed with the goal of facilitating the process of web application development. The micro framework uses the MVC, PHP / POO, Composer and Database framework with support for [Mysql and PostgreSQL], providing standards for specialized web development projects such as:

- [Routing system](https://worksena.xyz/documentacao/rotas).
- [Automated Layout Rendering](https://worksena.xyz/documentacao/views).
- [MVC design standard with modularization](https://worksena.xyz/documentacao/controller).
- [Dependency Injection](https://worksena.xyz/documentacao/injecao-de-dependencia)

A micro-framework is used when there is no need for a very robust framework, whose functionalities will not be completely applied, having a loss of performace, space and productivity. Here are the micros-Frameworks :raised_hands:
